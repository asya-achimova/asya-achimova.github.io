        <h1>Effect of surprise on speech production and comrehension</h1>
        <p> Speakers take into account a number of linguistic and cognitive factors when they choose how to refer to a previously mentioned entity. In this project, we investigate how speakers describe surprising and non-surprising events. To quantify surprise as a cognitive category, we first evaluate what expectations speakers have about possible event progressions. We can further manipulate prior expectations by training the participants possible interactions between novel characters. We then ask participants to create simple narratives and observe how they refer to different characters.
        </p>
        <p> We demonstrate that speakers choose more informative references when they describe surprising events. Is this caution warranted? What happens when listeners perceive such event descriptions in noisy environment? In a new collaboration project with Marjolein van Os, Vera Demberg, and Martin Butz we explore how participants weigh their prior expectations and the linguistic signal in the process of utterance comprehension.
